# ML_CNBC

This is a repository for the machine learning course for neuroscientists at the Center for Neural Basis of Cognition at CMU/PITT. This course was created to help neuroscientists learn the fundamentals of machine learning through regular programming and mathematics excercises. Here you will find the course syllabus, jupyter notebooks covering the exercises and algorithms in ML: A Probabilistic perspective, in addition to many data science resources covering programming tutorials, blogs, and scientific literature bridging the gap between neuroscience and ML.
