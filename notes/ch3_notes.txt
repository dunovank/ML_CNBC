Need to know what the distributions

Naive Bayes in 50 Lines:

http://www.brainyblog.net/2017/01/17/what-should-an-intro-to-machine-learning-course-look-like/

Basic algorithms: NB, LR, SVM KNN
Requirements about input data, continuous, discete features, data dim
assumptions it makes about data
When will it work, when will it not works
The learned model
How it is trained

Cross validation, hold out sets, circulatirty of analysis/overfitting
feature selection, n>>p, bias variance tradeoff

More advanced:
optimizaiton
more algorithms
statistical significance, permutaiton tetsts, signed rank test
data viz, unsupervxed methods, dim reductions
what o the weight values mean in a lienar classifier.

prior should look like what posterior

marginal likelihood

likelihood functions

Have people present data and see whether algoirthms can apply to this dataset.

How should I struture my data to plug it into the algorithm.
